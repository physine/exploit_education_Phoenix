### Stack Three ###

# Exploit:
python -c "print 'A'*64 + '\x9d\x06\x40'" | ./stack-three

# Notes:
- We want to  overflow buffer[64] into the pointer *fp via the gets() function
  directing code flow to the function complete_level().

- As *fp is a pointer to the memory address we need to overflow it with
  a memory address of complete_level().
- We open ./stack-three in gdb and enter the 'info functions' command
  to find the memory address of complete_level().
- We can now append the memory address to a buffer to overflow buffer[64]
  and pipe it all into ./stack-three like so.
