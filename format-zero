We need to change the changeme int which is part of the struct locals.

        int main(int argc, char **argv) {
                struct {
                char dest[32];
                volatile int changeme;
                } locals;
                char buffer[16];
                .
                .
                .

The format vuln is in the following line 

        sprintf(locals.dest, buffer);

sprintf differs from printf in that it does not print to stdout but boes copy chars to
a specified location.   

we can write up to 15 bytes into buffer which will be read into locals.dest. As you
probly can amagine 15 bytes is not enough to overflow dest, so need to put something into
buffer which will cause the overflow.

To do this %x can be used to format the string which will be read into dest. Normaly 
%x is used like so

        sprintf(writeTo, "some string %x", foo);

where %x is replaced with what ever the next value on the stack is, and in the
case of out vulnerable code it just reads what ever the next value on the stack is.

So, on running format-zero with enough %x one after another we get

        user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ ./format-zero

        Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!


The number of %x may changed as an unsinged int can either be 2 or 4 bytes.
Having one less %x gives

        user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ ./format-zero

        Uh oh, 'changeme' has not yet been changed. Would you like to try again?
